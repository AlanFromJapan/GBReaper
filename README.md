# GBReaper
GBReaper a Windows program to make your own tiles, maps and rip tiles from existing GB ROMS.

## Build me
You'll need an OLD version of Visual Studio. It was build on **Visual Studio C# 2010 Express**, which you should still be able to download for free on MSDN.

No idea if VS Studio express would work on recent Windows 11 etc. I am using an old Win7 VM. Microsoft provides some old Win7 VM for test with IE 9 & Edge.

The software itself once built runs nicely on Windows 10 (tested) but not on Linux. If you do manage to make it run on Linux please tell me!
